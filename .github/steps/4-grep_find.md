# Week 4

The goal of this week is:
- searching and editing files
- creating aliases
- learn about environmental variables

## 1. :book: Week 3 review
If you would like to read more from Software Carpentry to review week 3:
- [Loops](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop.html)
- [Shell Scripts](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script.html)


## 2.:book: Searching and editing files
- Read from [Software Carpentry to learn about `grep` and `find` commands](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find.html)
- Read from [How-To Geek website about `sed` command](https://www.howtogeek.com/666395/how-to-use-the-sed-command-on-linux/)

## 3. :keyboard: :white_check_mark: Exercise 1: 

In the new branch that was created for this week, `week4`, and you will find a new directory, `week4`, that will be used as a working directory for this week. In the directory you will find `massachusetts_cities.csv` file.
Create a script that finds all cities that have "North" in the name and save it to the new file "output.txt",
but instead of using format "<City>, <Population>" use a syntax "<City> has population of <Population>".

## 4.:book: Environmental Variables

An addditional topic that might be worth exploring is Environmental Variables. 
You could read more from [Geeks for Geeks about the topic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/environment-variables-in-linux-unix/).



> [!TIP]
> If you don't remember how to open Codespace, create a new file and add to the repository, you can review instruction from the previous week [here](./week1/Readme.md)

##

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update the repository in  order to move to the next week/part of the course:
>  - Create a Pull Request to the `main` branch
>  - Check the status of tests
>  - If all tests pass, merge the Pull Request, this should update a new `README.md` on the main page of the repository (you can reload the page after 30-60s if you don't see the new content)
